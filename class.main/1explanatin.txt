i have tried a simle experment in java.

i writen a class named Demo and also it consists of a main method along with a constructor.

next in main method i created an object for Demo.

next i invoke main method using class name Demo cuz which is a static method.

in between the obj creation and invoking a main method i inserted a static int varable (i++)

i found that the out put is very intersting.
go check copy the sourse code and find what will happen
